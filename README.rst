ðŸ“‹ Clipboard (fork)
=====================

This is a fork of the Clipboard Indicator extension by Tudmotu:
https://github.com/Tudmotu/gnome-shell-extension-clipboard-indicator

Changes from the original
-------------------------

- New name and UUID: `Clipboard` (`clipboard@journeycorner.com`).
- More minimal, user-friendly defaults and UI.
- Privacy auto-detection: automatically toggles Private Mode when screen
  sharing or screen recording is detected (to avoid storing sensitive content).
- Reduced false positives in privacy detection by observing explicit
  screen-share/record indicators.
- Removed unused/dead settings and minor cleanup for stability.
